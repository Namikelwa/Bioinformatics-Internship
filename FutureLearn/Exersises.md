excerpt from the diamonds.csv file

For this exercise, what we’d like you to do is create an interactive Bash script called diamonds.sh.

First, prompt the user to provide a cut and store their response in a variable called quality.

If the user enters either Fair or Good, return Insufficient quality to proceed.

If the user enters a value other than Premium, Ideal or Very Good, return Invalid cut.

Otherwise, count the number of diamonds (rows) which have the user-defined cut. Hint: look at the usage for grep to find an option that will count the number of lines which match a given pattern.

Please try to answer the questions yourself first and then compare the results with other learners. Finally, you can find solutions in the download area.
